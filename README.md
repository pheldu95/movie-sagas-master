## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

My movie display project allows the user to click on a movie poster, and then be brought to a page with more details on the movie. The user may also edit the title and description of the movie.
To make this app, I used sagas in order to make axios calls inside the index file. This allowed me to keep all of my axios calls in one place, and directly send the data to reducers.
The main challenge with this project was getting the SQL queries to work. 

To use the app, first you need to enter npm install into the terminal. Then, create a database using the queries in the database.sql file included. Return to the terminal and type npm run server. Finally, open a new tab and type npm run client.
